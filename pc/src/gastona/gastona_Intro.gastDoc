   <help>
      //
      // Gastona is text based, a whole application may be placed into a single text file using any
      // text editor. It is still possible to develope parts in java language but this documentation
      // will focus mainly in the functionality just using only the "Gastona scripting", which provides
      // quite large and amazing functionality.
      //
      // Gastona, Javaj and Listix "story"
      // -----------------------------------
      //
      // The Gastona approach has not been designed from the begining at all, it is actually the result
      // of fusioning two different "language-tools" that were developed separately and with totally
      // different purposes. One is "Javaj" designed for rapid development of GUI applications and
      // the second is "Listix" designed as a generic command line text generator. Interestingly, it
      // is also the fusion of two different worlds: The atractive User Interface world and the
      // "Black screen" command line world.
      //
      // If we take Gastona, Javaj and Listix as characters, this is the short story of their development:
      //
      // Javaj is a software arquitect specialized in User Interfaces and have a box of smart widgets
      // that he places onto a frame in many possible ways (layouts). Once the widgets are shown, and
      // acording to the Javaj philosophy, a java developer should programm java classes to control
      // the widgets (Javaj controllers).
      //
      // Listix is a command line program capable of doing very big jobs, calling other programs,
      // parsing files and generating his own results into text files. To instruct Listix what to do
      // there is a set of commands that Listix will execute efficiently. The only problem is that Listix
      // seems to be condemned to run always on a "black sreen".
      //
      // Gastona knowing the ability of both decided making them to work together. On one side the many
      // times mechanical work of the Javaj controllers could be done easily by Listix and on the other
      // side many good Listix scripts could have a nice face provided by Javaj.
      //
      // Gastona Structure
      // --------------------------------
      //
      // The text (script) is structured in four units : #gastona#, #javaj#, #listix# and #data#
      // Each unit is just a set of variables, each one can hold from a single string to a table or
      // other more complex structures. The meaning of these variables depends entirely on the context
      // and on who makes use of it.
      //
      // Briefly explained:
      //
      //  - Javaj find in the unit #javaj# all the widgets to be used and how to place them in frames
      //
      //  - Javaj widgets find its data, or better said its initial data, in the section #data#
      //
      //  - Listix find all "work to do" in the units #listix# and #data#
      //
      //  - Gastona has also an own unit, but it has not the importance of the rest.
      //
      // Since Listix has access to #data# it has access to widgets' data too, this is needed since
      // we want Listix to control the widgets.
      //
      // Here a very basic sample to illustrate all this
      //
      //    #javaj#
      //
      //       <frames> Fmain, "Basic sample app"
      //
      //       <layout of Fmain>
      //          PANEL, X
      //          bPress Me, eField
      //
      //    #data#
      //
      //       <eField> Default data
      //
      //    #listix#
      //
      //       <-- bPress Me>
      //          SET VAR, eField, "Hello Sample"
      //          MESSAGE, eField data!
      //
      // Running the sample would display a frame with a button labeled "Press Me" and a edit field
      // having the text "Default data", once the button is pressed the edit field will change its
      // content with "Hello Sample".
      //
      // Javaj and Listix are documented separately. Most of this documentation consists in fact in
      // two references: a reference of all layouts and widgets of Javaj and a reference of all Listix
      // commands.
      //
      // About layouts ...
      // All layouts in Javaj are intuitive and easy to use. Using the one called EVALAYOUT together
      // with the layout composition mechanism allows building very complex layouts using few lines.
      // Enabling the variable <PAINT LAYOUT> in the #gastona# unit might help on learning the layout
      // techniques.
      //
      // About Javaj widgets...
      // Many of them work in a very similar way and it should be enough to learn well a couple of them
      // to understand easily the rest.
      //
      // About Listix ...
      // For a basic control of the widgets few things has to be learnt and these are repeated in all
      // samples. Nevertheless the Listix commands offers much more functionality. Every command has its
      // own syntax that can be more or less complex. But, as it happen with libraries, not all the
      // commands has to be learned in order to write useful scripts.
      //
      // Eva format
      // --------------------------------
      //
      // Finally, the format used for these units and variables is called EVA. I hope it is quite
      // intuitive and that it can be deduced from the many samples. You can find a more formal
      // documentation on "EvaFormatV1.1.pdf"(*) but maybe this few indications would be enough to
      // understand it:
      //
      //    Empty lines as well as lines starting with <! or #! are ignored (comments)
      //
      //    #uuu# starts a unit named "uuu", the rest of the line is not used
      //
      //    <eee> starts an eva variable named "eee", the rest of the line MAY BE part of its content
      //
      //    An Eva variable can consist of 1 or more rows
      //
      //    Each row can contain more columns which are comma separated
      //
      //    If either // or ' are found at the beginning of a column, it indicates that all characters
      //    following this beginning are the contents of the column, and therefore it becomes the last
      //    column of the row
      //
      //    All columns of an Eva variable (except if last column with // or ') might be enclosed in
      //    quotation marks ("..."), but this is only strictly necessary if containing commas, blanks at
      //    the beginning or at the end, or a quotation mark which has to be expressed using two
      //    characters ("")
      //
      //    A unit starting with two asterisks (#**...#) is a "logical" end of the EVA file
