====== ABOUT THE SQLITE BINARY DISTRIBUTED

The version of sqlite binary distributed here is 

   SQLite version 3.9.2 2015-11-02 18:31:45


SQLite has no license since is PUBLIC DOMAIN (actually the most generous license!)
   
   https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html
   
====== GASTONA IMPLEMENTATION NEEDS SQLITE!

The use in Gastona of sqlite is mandatory (not optional!) since it is the native SQL support
of all commands that use it as well as widgets when the data source is a database.

It is important to provide a binary for all platforms

   Windows, Linux and Linux 64bit and RaspberryPi (ARM processor)

====== GASTONA ANDROID AND SQLITE

Unfortunately the approach of microTool cannot be used in Android due to
execution permission policies. So, although a binary could be provided, it
actually cannot be launched. For that reason in gastona Android sqlite is 
accessed internally via the android sqlite provided API which unfortunately has 
some drawbacks (e.g. DB EXECUTE can not contain multiple statements even if they are 
separated by semicolons!).

====== CHECKED ALTERNATIVES TO SQLITE

Actually any executable behaving like sqlite command line can be used to replace sqlite.
Specifically it has been tested with PostgreSQL (pgsql) and with a mix of sqlite3 and Berkeley DB

   from Oracle Berkeley DB documentation:

   Berkeley DB and SQLite link together via a new adapter layer that hides all the Berkeley DB APIs 
   underneath the SQLite interface. Thus, applications written to the SQLite version 3 API can switch 
   to using Oracle Berkeley DB with no code changes, by re-linking against the Berkeley DB SQLite library. 
   The application-level behavior of the two products is identical, but the advanced features of Berkeley 
   DB provide SQLite applications improved performance, concurrency, scalability, and reliability.

Looking forward to study if something simlar is possible with sqlite and Kyoto Cabinet!
